## The City of Wuhai

Wuhai is a blood-soaked cross between Hong Kong, Las Vegas, and New York City, situated on the coast of the Masursky Bay, formed by the now-flooded Masursky meteor impact site, and surrounded on all other sides by The Expanse of Mars' vast, red desert.

Originally a mining colony in the earliest days of Martian colonisation, named after an old-earth city that few remember. The Wuhai of the modern era is a wholly unique organism, a thriving, independent city-state, a melting pot of cultures and interests, and a major commercial and cultural hub.

Wuhai, like many similar settings, is a city of contrasts: the sleek corporate towers of Utashino Estates versus the lawless unknown of the Yamaloka Dark Zone; the high-tech lifestyle of the wealthy elite contrasted with the harsh realities faced by those who dodge bullets on the war-torn streets of Heng Fa.

While powerful criminal factions fight for control of Wuhai's streets, the city also finds itself caught in the crossfire of an ever-present cold war between corporate blocs, eager to exploit its unique economic and strategic position.

## Districts of Wuhai

### Awanaka Industrial Zone - Heavy Industry
{/* <Accordion client:load title="Show/Hide"> */}

<Tabs client:load>

    <Tab name="Background">

    #### Traits

    <p class="text-center pt-2 pb-0">**Wealth:** ★☆☆☆☆ <span class="ml-10">**Security:** ★★★☆☆</span></p>
    <p class="text-center pt-0 pb-0">**Corp-Influence:** ★★★☆☆ <span class="ml-7">**Gang-Influence:** ★★★☆☆</span></p>

    #### Background

    A sprawling network of smokestacks, factories, and foundries spewing endless chemical effluvia.

    At the heart of the industrial zone looms the ShinMaywa Nuclear Power Station (or simply: "The Shinwa Station"), providing energy to Wuhai and its surrounding regions. Its looming cooling towers and dense web of pipes and conduits dominate the landscape for miles around.

    When the wind blows in the wrong direction, pollutants from the foundries are cast across vast swathes of Wuhai's East Side. Pollutants include aluminium, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide, sulphuric acid, e-coli, and sodium chloride, to name just a few.

    Augmentation can help to counteract the hostile environment of Awanaka, not that those who live and work in the danger-zone can afford such luxuries. Matter of fact, some of the labourers wear their lack of protective augmentations as a point of pride, an attitude not discouraged by the corporate propaganda machine.

    #### Scene
    > Flames spew from mile-high smokestacks. The skies shrouded in perpetual haze. Workers cling like limpets to steel a mile in the air. The ShinWa Station's monolithic cooling towers loom overhead, blotting out the sun, leaving most of the district in darkness. Sinuses on fire; the air is so thick with pollutants you can taste it.
    

    </Tab>

    <Tab name="Notables">
    #### Factions

    ##### ShinMaywa Energy
    - A titan of energy production. The energy arm of the larger ShinMaywa Corporation, part of the Zhonghua Consolidat.
    - On the surface, they present themselves as benevolent providers of power. They guard their monopoly with a private army, silencing whistleblowers, and falsifying environmental reports.

    ##### Vytal Industries
    - One of the oldest corporate presences on Mars, and responsible for carving out and processing huge amounts of raw material from the planet's surface during the terraforming era.
    - Vytal Industries have driven the incredible pace of Wuhai's construction, from pouring concrete to smelting steel.
    - Among workers, Vytal's foundries are known as "The Crucible", a literal trial by fire that leaves bodies burned, broken, and discarded like slag.

    ##### The Red Ash Union
    - A terror cell born of former industrial workers with a burning vendetta against the industries that have left many of them disfigured and broken.

    ##### The Grinders
    - A gang of industrial scavengers, trawling the district's vast waste heaps, siphoning chemical overspills and carving augmentations from the corpses left behind by industrial accidents.

    #### People
    ##### Dr. Kaia Sorell
    - An Environmental engineer at Shinwa Station with a surprising depth of conscience.

    ##### Iron-Lung Murakami
    - A shift foreman at Vytal, known for surviving for decades among the smog, supposedly with no environmental protection augs. He wears his scarred throat and disturbing voice as a badge of honour.

    ##### The Awanaka Ripper
    - An urban myth. They say those lost in the smog are taken by the Ripper, their bodies mutilated, missing limbs and organs. Oddly enough, their augmentations are left untouched.

    #### Landmarks
    ##### The ShinWa Station
    - At the heart of the district stands the immense cooling towers of the Shinwa Station. Its output responsible for the majority of Wuhai's power supply.
    - Industrial accidents and toxic spills over years of poor waste management have left hidden pockets of the surrounding area lethally radioactive, as many enterprising scavengers have discovered, shortly before their agonising deaths.

    ##### The Fabs
    - A collective name for the miles wide, labyrinthine sprawl of fabrication units and refineries that make up most of the district.
    - In aid of ceaseless production at the lowest cost, many of these units are well past their recommended operational lifespans, and they aren't dying quietly.

    ##### The Blocks
    - Corporate housing projects, riddled with black mould and corrosion. A miserable, but heavily subsidised existence. Better than life on the streets, but only just.
    - The Blocks are a powder-keg, waiting for the embers of revolution to spark.

    ##### The Black Zone
    - The most toxic area of the district. A waste heap, drenched in corrosive chemicals and radioactive materials. No one lives here, but suicidal scavengers occasionally risk it for rare industrial salvage. At night, it glows faintly.

    </Tab>

    <Tab name="Hooks / Encounters">
    
    #### Hooks
    - Dr. Kaia Sorell, Environmental Engineer at Shinwa Station regularly falsifies reports under corporate pressure. Riddled with guilt, she is looking for a crew to acquire and smuggle data proving the radiation leaks are far worse than reported.
    - A faction based outside of Awanaka want to recover a shipment of military-grade Augmentations lost somewhere in the district. Everybody in Awanaka wants it, bad.
    - People speak of The Beast that prowls the Black Zone, seemingly immune to its hazards. Rumours range from a giant mutant dog, to a sentient mass of biological material.
    - A recent earthquake causes part of the district to collapse, revealing a deep network of subterranean chambers. Corporate warning signs line the walls. Rumours spread of rare salvage and secret blacksite projects hidden within.
    - An attack on Shinwa Tower 4 is thwarted, but not without injuring dozens of workers, and badly damaging the base of the tower. Officially, the company blames the Red Ash Union, but the Union claim no responsibility. Both sides want to know who's truly responsible, and why.
    - The Red Ash Union are preparing to assault a ShinMaywa administration building, with the aim of taking hostages. They can't pull it off without gear and manpower.

    | 1_ON_D8 | A sudden shift in the wind fills the area with a dense smog. Visibility drops to a few meters, and everyone without respirators struggles. Shapes move in the fog. Scavengers? ShinWa Security patrols? Or just something in the air?     |
    | 2_ON_D8 | A mob of furious workers, supporters of the Red Union, are blockading the gates of a Vytal industries foundry. Security drones hover overhead, and private security forces gather on the other side of the fence. A gunshot rings out.    |
    | 3_ON_D8 | A malfunctioning industrial loading bot has gone haywire and is tearing its way through a busy construction yard, toward a container full of volatile demolition supplies.                                                                |
    | 4_ON_D8 | A jittery ganger calls to the PCs from a nearby alley, offering cheap augmentations. The offer is legit, but the augs have clearly been freshly ripped from corpses. Some of his stock still twitches.                                    |
    | 5_ON_D8 | A scream emanates from a nearby burning slag heap and a severely burnt figure crawls out from within.                                                                                                                                     |
    | 6_ON_D8 | A sudden downpour carries toxic chemicals. A group of disfigured squatters huddle beneath jury-rigged shelters. They grab at the PCs with melted hands and beg for meds, respirators and food.                                            |
    | 7_ON_D8 | A freight truck carrying volatile fuel crashes near a highway support pillar and begins to spill out its contents into the street. Multiple groups of scavengers spring from the shadows in an attempt to siphon it. Fighting breaks out. |
    | 8_ON_D8 | A high-pressure conduit pipe explodes, spewing chemical vapour toward the PCs. The gas burns exposed skin and corrodes weapons.                                                                                                           |

### Central - Old Colony & Administration
{/* <Accordion client:load title="Show/Hide"> */}
<br/>
<Tabs client:load>

    <Tab name="Background">

    #### Traits

    <p class="text-center pt-0 pb-0">**Wealth:** ★★★☆☆ <span class="ml-10">**Security:** ★★★☆☆ </span></p>
    <p class="text-center pt-0 pb-0">**Corp-Influence:** ★★★☆☆ <span class="ml-7">**Gang-Influence:** ★★★☆☆</span></p>

    #### Background
    The Central District of Wuhai is the epicentre of academia, transport, and government.

    The heart of the Colony in the earliest days of colonisation. Now, outside of the narrow lanes of Komorebi Arcade, there are virtually no signs of the prefab units and habitations that were once the totality of Wuhai.

    Wuhai's halls of governance are stacked around the Administrative Sector, where the poorly oiled machinery of city management grinds away, vainly attempting to exert influence over a city that defies their control.

    #### Scene
    > The ground shakes as a train tears past on the overhead metro line. A washed up politician preaches in futility to the throng of uninterested corporate drones who filter along the main street. A group of students tumble out from the narrow streets of Komorebi Arcade, one of them has a traffic cone on their head. 

    </Tab>

    <Tab name="Notables">
    #### Factions
    ##### Nakayama Next
    - The Nakayama-funded Education programme, sub-titled the "Birth to Boardroom" initiative, grooming the next generation of corporate leaders.

    ##### City Bureaucrats
    - A hollow machine, overstaffed, underfunded, and easily manipulated. A regular mouthpiece and scapegoat for the corporations that run Wuhai.
    - Among the ranks are some who truly want to do some good for the people of Wuhai, but their efforts are an uphill battle.

    ##### The Komorebi Collective
    - A loose association of business owners, artists, and residents living in and around Komorebi Arcade.
    - They oppose redevelopment plans, but their resources are perpetually stretched thin. Some are in favour of siding with organised crime to preserve their small measure of independence.

    ##### The Regenesis Trust
    - A seemingly philanthropic front, tied to Regenesis Medical. They fund public charities, clinics, and health programmes used by many in more deprived areas.

    #### People
    ##### Mayor Haoyu Xian
    - The official Mayor of Wuhai. A once-idealistic politician. Now a hollow and corrupted shell of his former self, clinging to the prestige and benefits of his office.

    ##### Captain Darius Kade
    - Head of Operations at Cerberus HQ. A hardened former trooper who fought his way to his office, running the city's private police force. Obsessed with order, and not above staging public crime-busting operations in aid of this.

    ##### Professor Mizue Nakayama
    -  A brilliant, but controversial geneticist, Chancellor of Nakayama University, and sister to the corporation's CEO. Steers Nakayama's education programme.

    #### Landmarks
    ##### The Administration Sector
    - **City Hall:** City Hall stands as the beating heart of Wuhai's government. Or so they say. In reality, this building is more symbol than substance, with decisions largely made in corporate boardrooms, behind closed doors.
    - **Wuhai Central Court**: With most cases handled remotely, with verdicts delivered by an AI jury, the Central Court's grand chambers are a glorified reality TV set, reserved for high-profile cases only.


    ##### Komorebi Arcade
    - Komorebi Arcade is a rare glimpse into the city's history. Originally designed as the recreational heart of the colony, the Arcade is a labyrinth of narrow, covered streets and alleys, many of which still comprised (at least partially) of prefabricated units. The arcade is lined with small bars, quirky shops, and the modest offices of small businesses.

    ##### Nakayama University
    - Not far from Komorebi Arcade, stands Nakayama University. A highly exclusive institution, funded by the Nakayama Corporation. A sprawling campus, renowned for its excellence in engineering and biological sciences. Part of the birth to boardroom pipeline.
    - Despite its corporate roots, there's a small but increasingly popular anti-establishment culture among some of the students. A culture the deans of education are eager to stamp out.

    ##### Central Station
    - Central Station is Wuhai's main transport hub, enabling transport across the city via bullet-train. 
    - For more private journeys, ranks of taxis wait to ferry passengers to their destinations via road or, more exclusively, air.

    ##### Cerberus Group Headquarters
    - The imposing, brutalist tombstone of the Cerberus Group Headquarters serves as the public face of security in Wuhai. 
    - From this fortress, the city's private police force coordinate efforts to maintain order.

    ##### Regenesis Medical Centre
    - The Regenesis Medical Centre is the city's largest and most advanced medical care facility, and indeed, the largest for hundreds of miles.
    - Its cutting-edge medical technology is available to those with the ₩on to afford medical insurance.
    - The 61st floor houses the VIP wing, offering the most premium of care, with the greatest of discretion.

    - The Castler Group, an urban development corp, are looking to bulldoze Komorebi Arcade, buying out business owners and bullying those who refuse their offers. The Komorebi Collective are looking for support to try and put a halt to their plans, but the PCs weren't the first group they reached out to.
    - Dr Seika Morimoto, a former Regenesis surgeon, now runs a free clinic in Ward 17, a particularly deprived area of Central. Her patients are all reporting the same, strange symptoms, and she suspects foul play.
    - A group of concerned students at Nakayama Uni are worried about one of their fellow students, who has recently gone missing. They suspect their professor knows more about it than he's letting on.
    - A bar in Komorebi is the scene of the gruesome death of an ill-looking patron. In the days that follow, other members of the community fall ill with similar symptoms. Regenesis move quickly to quarantine the area. Rumours spread of a bio-engineered virus, unleashed somewhere within the cordon.

    | 6_ON_D8 | A panicked woman, dressed in a medical gown, flees down an alley, directly into the path of the PCs. She's desperate to get away. If helped, she talks of a secret wing of the Regenesis Medical Centre. |

    | 8_ON_D8 | The metro train the PCs are on is hacked, and suddenly accelerates to maximum speed. If nothing is done, it will collide with the stationary train at the next station.                                  |

    #### Background
    Daishin Heights is a district of exclusive corporate housing. Its luxury apartments and heavily-guarded streets serving as the ideal place for corporations to protect and monitor their employees.

    The shops and services of the district employ a system of Corporate Credit separate from the ₩on used elsewhere in the city, to ensure that all transactions made within its walls are carefully tracked and accounted for.
    Employees are typically signed up to a basic subscription plan as part of their contracts, affording them access to the services required to maintain their corporate lifestyles. This subscription comes in four Tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

    #### Scene
    > Towering glass facades mirror the sky. Too clean streets, holographic foliage, the smell of disinfectant. Soft classical music seeps from a speaker mounted...somewhere? A woman pushes a stroller down the street, she smiles widely at you; a cherubic plastic face stares blankly out at the world from beneath the canopy of the stroller.

    Platinum Plaza is a playground for the corporations who built and run Wuhai. For the privileged few who work in the Plaza, life is a whirlwind of power lunches, negotiations, and soirées. 
    
    The district's streets are meticulously clean, and patrolled by private security forces. However, beneath the veneer of prosperity, corporate warfare rages. Corporate espionage to carefully staged murder, there's little those who inhabit this reality won't do to see numbers go up.

    #### Background
    The Tenjin Parlor District is the city's largest red-light district. A hive of desire, built around the district's sinuous, vein-like network of canals.

    Those savvy in the ways of the district choose to navigate it by private boat, and know well to avoid the taxi-boat services offered to tourists.

    The Tenjin Parlor District is under the domain of the Arashi Syndicate, a powerful Yakuza family that operates with a strict, and unwavering code.


    #### Scene
    > The wake of the small skiff displaces the sultry lights that dance upon the surface of the canal. Small jetties and mooring points on either side grant access to the bright and attractive facades of brothels, clubs, and bars, catering to the niches of all manner of clientele. A cacophony of music leaks from these buildings out into the street. Up ahead, a small bridge cuts across the waterway. A figure, silhouetted by neon light, leans over the side of it, then throws up violently into the water.

    #### Background

    In the heart of Wuhai, stretching far to the North and South, cutting a distinct line through Central, is The Strand.

    Also known as The Strand, the district is teeming with life, commerce, and entertainment. Lavish casinos, theatres, clubs, and vibrant markets line the strand, each one battling for attention.

    #### Scene
    > A dozen different holographic advertisements for casinos and clubs seem to chase each other, flowing across facades on all sides, each one brighter and louder than the last. Below and to the right, a sunken market plaza is alive with the flow of shoppers, sellers hawking discount wares, and food sizzling atop open flames. Smells collide: spices, meat, sweat, and oil. A pickpocket's paradise.

    #### Scene
    > Spotless roads snake through rolling green hills, each bend revealing opulent mansions of glass and marble, each one a bespoke work of art, perched like temples above the sea. The breeze carries a scent of salt and perfume over the wrought iron gates and manicured hedgerows of pristine villas.

    #### Background

    To the north of Wuhai lies Heng Fa, an industrial, working-class district caught in the crossfire of a savage gang war. On the streets and waterways of Heng Fa, The Heisei Cartel and The Galyeojin run the rivers red.

    Meanwhile, The Arashi Syndicate, operating from the nearby Tenjin District, seek to maintain control over the borders of their own territory in a war of attrition with the nearby corporate sector, pushing them ever further into the already-crowded Heng Fa.

    #### Scene
    > Gunfire cracks in the distance; multiple short bursts that echo loud and hollow in the narrow alleys between rusted shipping containers. Along the trash-choked Ankoru river, a small tugboat drifts silently along, its deck crew tense, eyes scanning the walkways above. Two kids in patched-up jackets seem to sense something amiss, and scurry into the shelter of a nearby noodle shop. Before you know it, a black sedan screeches past, windows down, barrels out..

    - The Heng Fa Docks, a nexus of maritime activity, and a critical lifeline, facilitating the covert transport of goods and contraband.
    - Nearby, the Heng Fa Fishmarket serves as a hub of both legitimate and illegitimate trade.

    ##### Galyeojin Territory
    - On the Eastern front, the Galyeojin establish dominion, centred around the vibrant enclave known as "Little Seoul".
    - The Galyeojin lay claim to the Heng Fa Container Terminal, an important strategic asset, hard-won in their ongoing rivalry with the Heisei Cartel.

    ##### The Battleground
    - The Seaboard that stretches from the Heng Fa Docks in the West to the Heng Fa Container Terminal in the East is a perpetually contested battleground.
    - The Ankoru River that slices through the district is another focal point of conflict. Blocks and tenements along its banks are hotly contested, and the constant skirmishes for control have turned the streets of this community into a war zone.

    #### Background

    Obscured by darkness and despair, lies the nightmarish labyrinth known as the Kamaga Dark Zone. The powers of Wuhai have long since given up on trying to police Kamaga, their attempts in the past ending in failure and violent rebellion.

    The Dark Zone is a dizzyingly tall, overcrowded stack of crumbling, dilapidated structures that seem to meld into one another, forming a tangled web of narrow alleys, sewage-slick staircases, and mould-filled tunnels.

    #### Scene
    > The walls of the narrow alley sweat with condensation and filth. The air reeks of grease, sweat, and rot. Rain filters down exposed pipes and cables from a sky that no longer exists, obscured entirely by a patchwork ceiling of rusted metal and rotten wood. Muffled conversations can be heard through the thin walls of stacked tenements. A neon sign flickers to life then dies, rats scatter into darker recesses.

    ##### Traffickers
    - The Dark Zone attracts many who deal in human lives. Hidden away from the prying eyes of the world, their victims find themselves trapped in this desolate corner of Wuhai with no hope of escape.

    ##### Unlicensed Practitioners
    - These practitioners, shunned by the legitimate medical world, offer their services to the desperate denizens of the Dark Zone. While their skills may be crude and their methods questionable, for many, they are the only hope of receiving medical attention.

    #### Background

    Amidst the tenements of Wuhai's north-west side lies Fallen Eden - a grim, multi-level district of rotten shacks, clinging to the skeletal remains of failed developments.

    Initially part of city development plans known as the "New Eden Expansion Zone", a large part of Heng Fa was torn down to make way for luxury apartments like Shinrin Heights and services such as the City One Commercial Centre.
    However, construction was repeatedly stalled by poor infrastructure, local gang warfare, and financial fraud.

    Now, Fallen Eden is a vertical slum. Shacks, lean-tos, and makeshift homes cling perilously to the dilapidated skeletons of tenements and half-constructed developments.

    More and more sinkholes have been forming in the district as of late, with many fearing that one day the entire district will be swallowed whole.

    #### Scene
    > Above, Shinrin Heights looms, makeshift homes cling like barnacles to the complex’s exposed framework, laundry swaying from steel struts ten stories above. Eyes watch from scaffolding like perched birds of prey. Below, a fresh sinkhole has swallowed an entire block. Somewhere nearby, in a maze of corrugated metal and plastic sheeting, a scream, then silence.

    - Those who disappear in the shadows of Wuhai often turn up here, lifeless and mutilated. Limbs, eyes, and organs (cyber or meat) removed.

    Those who live out here tend to be tough-as-nails survivalist types, organised into close-knit and highly territorial units. You need any sense of security you can get out here, as roving Reaver gangs trawl these sands, eager to pray on the vulnerable and alone.

    To the North of Wuhai lies the secretive fishing town of Seaboard B8, colloquially known as "Bait".
    
    Bait has views across the water of Wuhai's gleaming skyline, and the distant shores of Bayside and Utashino. Here residents bring in their daily catch, sustaining a way of life from the artificial oceans of Mars.

    Much of the wharf is taken up by the "Vostok Enclave", a ramshackle town of cargo containers. What happens behind its walls, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone willing to talk about it.

    #### Scene
    > Fog hangs low over the docks, clinging to rusted cranes and weather-beaten trawlers. The scent of brine and diesel oil chokes the air. Locals in heavy coats unload their nets without a word, eyes fixed on the task, never straying toward the stacked cargo containers of the Vostok Enclave. Out across the water, the lights of Wuhai’s skyline try vainly to penetrate the fog.

    #### Background

    This rural backwater town clings to Wuhai's fringes. 
    
    Built hastily and cheaply from old pre-fabricated colonisation units, Takhoma was originally designed as temporary housing to accommodate the mass influx of migrants from Earth.

    As the processing of identification and citizenship ground to a halt under the immense weight of new arrivals, many chose to settle in for the long haul. For decades, the park has been its own, semi-independent entity.

    The Factions of Takhoma Park are deeply distrustful of the corporations and government entities that dominate Wuhai. They see themselves as free spirits, fiercely independent and protective.

    #### Scene
    > Dust swirls in the fading light. Smoke curls from old life-support vents, mounted to leaning prefab homes. Solar panels glint atop rusting rooftops, and the scent of burning wood and grease hangs heavy in the dry air. A dust-covered kid on a rattling dirtbike tears down the gravel road toward you. They give you a dirty look before speeding off.
