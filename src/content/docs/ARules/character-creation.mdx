## Write Three "Aspects"

Who were you before, who are you now, how have you survived?

- Aspects are descriptors that define **the most iconic details** of your character's life and skills.
- Your Aspects are a combination of a **Background**, an **Archetype**, and a **Trait**.

<p class="text-center">The following table contains example Aspects, along with suggested skills and flaws.<br/>**Pick Three Aspects, one from each category.**</p>
<p class="text-center">**An Aspect can be almost anything. It's encouraged to mix and match, re-name, re-style, and work with the GM to create something that fits your vision**</p>

## Assign Points to Skills
Skills represent broad areas of knowledge. 
- Your choice of Skills should be relevant to your Aspects.
- Skills are rated from 0 - 4. Skills cannot go above +3 at Character Creation.
- When making a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), you roll Advantage Dice (AD <AD/>) equal to your Skill.
- Skills can be improved later using [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).

<br/>
- **GM Advice:** For games that intend to place the focus more/less on Combat, consider adjusting the starting number of points assigned to each category.
- Likewise, for more/less competent characters, consider adjusting the total number of points to spend up or down.

## Write Four Expertise
Expertise represent narrow, specialist areas of knowledge.
- Like Skills, Expertise should be relevant to your Aspects.
- Each Expertise should be unique. You cannot list the same Expertise twice, even across multiple different skills.
- New Expertise can be acquired later using [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).
- Each Skill can have at most 3 Expertise. These can be swapped out during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).
- When making a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), each relevant Expertise grants +1 Advantage Die <AD/>.
- You can use multiple Expertise in a single Check, as long as they're attached to the same Skill being used.<br/>
    - *If you have a relevant Expertise attached to a different Skill, you can make a case for how you apply it in a different context.<br/>The GM has final say about whether or not it is appropriate.*
    - The tables above include examples where an Expertise might be relevant to multiple skills, such as Intimidate (Fighting, Influence), or Sneak (Mobility, Subterfuge), judge appropriateness based on the context in which the Expertise is being used.


<p>
- **GM Advice:** For for more competent characters, consider adjusting the total number of starting Expertise to 6.
</p>

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**Pick Four Expertise from the table above, or make up your own.**<br/>**Write them in the space next to relevant skills.**</p>
<br/>


## Write Three to Six "Flaws"

Flaws are details that can be invoked (either by yourself, or the GM) to hinder you.
- When a Flaw is invoked during a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), you add 1 Threat Die <TD/>, making the check more difficult.
- When a Flaw impedes you in this way, you restore a single [Action Point](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#action-points). <br/>
- Each Flaw can only be invoked once per-job. It can still impact the fiction, but it won't apply <TD/> or restore Action Points.
*Action Points can be spent to avoid harm and take control of the action.*
- The more Flaws you have, the more likely they are to cause your character trouble, however, more Flaws means more opportunities to restore Action Points.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**Pick Three to Six Flaws from the table above, or make up your own**<br/>**You should have one or two for each Aspect.**</p>
<br/>

---

## Pick Starting Gear
Characters start with an amount of gear and augmentations; useful belongings acquired in their lives up to this point.

#### Basic Information
##### Loadout
**Gear Slots** represented with: (◆) indicate how bulky an item is.
- Characters pick a Loadout between Light (Max 3 ◆'s worth of items), and Heavy (Max 6 ◆'s worth of items), and declare all Heavy (◆◆◆) Items before a job begins.<br/>**You don't need to worry about this now.**
- A character's loadout implies how geared-up an Character appears to observers.<br/> *The heavier your loadout, the more obviously ready for action you appear.*

<p class="text-center"> For more information, see: [Gear System](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gearsystem) </p>

##### Features
Items and Augmentations have Features. Details that define what actions they allow, and any specific advantages and disadvantages they may have.
- **Some actions are Enabled by gear.**<br/>*Meaning, the use of this gear allows you to do something you previously couldn't.*
- **Some gear have Advantages**<br/>*Advantages might add Advantage Dice <AD/> to relevant checks, or provide some other benefit.*
- **Likewise, some gear may have Disadvantages**.<br/>*Disadvantages might reduce a Skill, add Threat Dice <TD/> to relevant checks, or be purely fictional problems, (E.g. Slow, Low-Range, Noisy, etc.).*
- **Some pieces of gear have limited uses.**<br/>*This could be a limited duration (E.g. up to an hour), limited uses per-job (recovered during Downtime), or are consumed on use (E.g. Grenades, Drugs).*
- **Features and Advantages are only applied when they become relevant.** <br/>*For example, the Survival Kit's +1<AD/> to Survival checks only applies when attempting something specific to the kit.*
- **Items and Augmentations can also be upgraded with Mods**.<br/>*Mods can add features, remove disadvantages, and further individualise Gear.<br/> Mods are not available during Character Creation, and must be acquired through play.*

<p class="text-center"> For more information, see: [Gear System](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gearsystem) </p>

### Tools of the Trade

**All characters start with 3d6x100 ₩**.

**Then, pick one of the following configurations:**
- **A.** An Item related to Trademarks + a mix of 3 Drugs/Grenades
- **B.** A Vehicle related to Trademarks.
<br/>
**As well as one of the following:**
- **A.** A Melee Weapon or Light Sidearm + Security-Grade Armour
- **B.** A Heavy Sidearm, Rifle, or Shotgun.

<br/>
**Choose from the lists below, or work with the GM to create something more bespoke.**

##### Augmentation
**Augs are expensive, but enable you to surpass ordinary human limits.**<br/> You can think of them like "Stunts" or "Feats" from other systems.
- **Characters start with 3 Aug Slots, and each Aug takes up 1 Slot.**<br/> Each Augmentation places strain upon the body.<br/> You can't go beyond this limit right now, but you can later using [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).
- **Characters start with a choice of Common or Uncommon Augs.**<br/>Some Augmentations are rarer than others. Rare Augs can be acquired during play.
- **You can purchase, install and swap out Augs during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).** <br/> Your choices now don't have to be permanent, just go with what seems cool.
<br/>
**Choose some starting Augmentations. Pick one of the following configurations:**
- **A.** Two Common Augs
- **B.** One Uncommon Aug

#### Heavily Augmented Characters
For characters who's background involves having a lot of Augmentations, discuss with the GM how to reconcile this discrepancy with the limited starting options. 

**For example:**
- A former-corp agent may have been provided with expensive Augs, but they have since been remotely shut down by the company.
- A thug, wired up with chop-shop Augs would likely struggle with the ongoing maintenance required, leaving them to rust and fall into disrepair.

#### Un-Augmented Characters
For characters who prefer to remain pure and untainted by Augmentation, add two [Mods](/rustpnk/docs/etables/gear) to your chosen Starting Items/Weapon/Armour/Vehicle. Keeping up with the augmented competition wasn't cheap.

If you are stuck for ideas, you can use [this list](https://onestopforwriters.com/character_motivations) for inspiration.

This can (and likely will) change over time, or once you start playing and your character's situation changes, which is fine. **It's main function is to let the GM know your Character's ambitions so they can work it into scenarios.**

### Fleshing Out
Discuss these, if you have a cool idea already, great! Write it down!

If not, no worries, there's no need to solidify these details now. <br/>**All of the following can be decided during play. Declare details when the situation calls for it.**

**What do you look like, what do you act like?** <br/>This can be a broad description, a general vibe of your look, behaviour and fashion choices.

Play to your **Aspects** and **Flaws**.

- What is the first thing people notice about you before you speak?
- Do you have a particular signature item of clothing, or colour?
- Do you have any openly visible scars, piercings or tattoos?
- Do you have a particular affectation, bad habit, or tic?
- Do you look to stand out, or blend in?

**How did you end up in Wuhai?** Establish a *general idea* for how and why your Character is in Wuhai.

These details help establish your character's implied knowledge and insight about Wuhai and beyond, and the kind of groups they may have ran into before.

Play to your **Connections**, **Drive** and your **Aspects**.

- Where were you born?<br/> Are they a Wuhai local? Are they a Migrant from another nation? Are they a nomad from the Expanse?
- Have they been here long?
- Do you have a favourite hang-out spot?<br/> Make one up and work with the GM to place it somewhere in the city.
- Where do they live? Do they have family here?
- Wuhai is hugely multi-cultural. What languages do they speak?
