<p class="text-center">**The following rules add depth and a system of shared progression for the PCs.<br/> This sub-system is great for longer campaigns, but is largely irrelevant for shorter games and one-shots.**
<br/><br/>**Introduce these steps after Character Creation, or after the first job. GM Discretion.**</p>

## Crew Archetype

Regardless of the focus of the game, the player characters are assumed to be part of a team.
 
In theory, this could be anything, but its recommended to pick something that places the Characters in the position of **Underdogs**, on the bottom rung of society, with a reason to hate the status quo.

<p class="text-center">**Discuss with the GM and choose a Crew Archetype that you're excited to explore,<br/> or roll on this list:**</p>

#### Archetypes
<div class="rolltable-crewarch">
|          | Archetype                        | Example Strengths                                                  |           | Archetype                          | Example Strengths                                                        |

</div>
If your group is more divided, consider the connections between player characters. What are they to each other?

If its a little vague, or the characters don't really know each other yet, either write a broad descriptor of what the group currently is (Drifters, Freelancers, Nobodies, etc.).<br/> Do a few more jobs and come back to it.

Playing to the **Strengths** of your **Archetype** earns you **Status** at the end of a job. As your Status increases, your crew gain additional benefits. See [Crew Advancement](/rustpnk/docs/arules/crew-faction#crew-advancement) below.

## Contacts & Faction Relations

### Crew Contacts
Much like individual Characters, the crew have access to Contacts; a network of friends, fixers, and experts.

#### Starting Contact
The Crew start knowing one shared, close **Contact**. 
<br/>One PC might have more of a connection with them than the others, but you all know them well enough to trust them.

<p class="text-center">**Give them a name, an occupation, as well as a detail about how you know them**.
<br/>**Make something up, or roll on the table below.**</p>


<div class="sonohead rolltable">
|          |                                             |           |                                                     |
| -------: | :------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1_ON_D12 | A family member with a local business       | 7_ON_D12  | A smuggler operating out of Heng Fa or Seaboard B-8 |

| 3_ON_D12 | A Fixer who trusts you                      | 9_ON_D12  | A journalist for an underground publication         |
| 4_ON_D12 | A bartender or club owner                   | 10_ON_D12 | A mechanic with a modest garage in the boonies      |
| 5_ON_D12 | A low-to-mid ranking corporate insider      | 11_ON_D12 | A retired mercenary                                 |
| 6_ON_D12 | A low-to-mid ranking member of a gang       | 12_ON_D12 | A jaded Cerberus beat-cop                           |
</div>

### Faction Relations
The Crew Sheet also tracks relations between the Crew and individual Factions.

<p class="text-center">**Your Faction Relations are represented with a 6-segment clock, which starts half-filled.**</p>

<p class="text-center">At 3/6 segments, your relation is Neutral, and your Rating is 0.<br/> As the clock fills your Rating increases. As the clock empties, your Rating decreases.</p>
<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 0/6 1/6 2/6 3/6 4/6 5/6 6/6 </div>
<p class="text-center">This rating, from **-3** to **+3** add **Advantage Dice** <AD/> or **Threat Dice** <TD/> to checks related to negotiations involving the faction.</p>

<div class="sonohead">
| Rating                                                      | Effects                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 6/6 </div> Allied    | This faction may be willing to put themselves at risk for you, as long as it doesn't contradict their aims, and possibly for nothing. But still don't expect them to do it regularly. |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 5/6 </div> Friendly  | This faction may be willing to put themselves at risk for you, but they'll be sure to collect on the favour.                                                                          |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 4/6 </div> Familiar  | This faction doesn't mind you. They might be inclined to help you in some minor way, for a price, and as long as it doesn't hurt them.                                                |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 3/6 </div> Neutral   | This faction doesn't care about your problems. They owe you nothing.                                                                                                                  |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 2/6 </div> Irritated | This faction is irritated about your recent behaviour, or encroachment on their territory. They might cause you complications.                                                        |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 1/6 </div> Enemies   | You've pissed this faction off big time. They'll almost certainly be looking to get payback in some form.                                                                             |
| <div class="clock w-full text-center"> 0/6 </div> War       | This faction hates you. You've done something unforgivable toward them or their allies. Expect bloodshed.                                                                             |
</div>

<br/>
#### Starting Relations
<p class="text-center">**Pick one local faction to have **+2 Relation**, and another to have **-1 Relation** with.**<br/>Work with the GM to pick these two factions.</p>

**Consider what this means for the crew.**
<br/>Maybe one is a group you've worked with before, and the other is group you've upset, or owe a favour to.

See [Factions](/rustpnk/docs/cfactions/) for a full list.

---

### Hostility
**Hostility** represents how likely your enemies are to make a move against you.

**Hostility** is displayed as three 3-Segment Clocks. For each full clock, your Hostility Rating increases. 

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 3/3 3/3 1/3 </div>
<p class="text-center"> Example: The crew have 2 Full Clocks, one at 1/3, the rest empty.<br/>The Crew have a Hostility Rating of 2. </p>

As your Hostility increases, the events and complications you'll face during downtime become more severe.

#### Gaining Hostility
Hostility is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:
<div class="sonohead">
|               |                                                                                                            |
| ------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    **Noise:** | If the job was loud and chaotic, **Gain +1 Hostility**.                                                    |
| **Evidence:** | If the Crew were identified, or left evidence linking back to them, **Gain +1 Hostility**.                 |
|  **Profile:** | If either of the above were true:<br/> **Gain +1 Hostility for each Rank of the Target above the Crew's.** |

</div>

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**Hostility clocks are spent by the GM during Downtime to introduce complications.**</p>

At any time between Jobs, usually during Life scenes (See: [Life Phase](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement#life-phase)) the GM can choose to spend any number of Full Hostility Clocks to introduce trouble and complications.

The more Clocks spent, the greater the potential complication could be:
- Single-Clock complications are rarely more than threats, or petty acts of vandalism.
- A Three-Clock complication usually means murderous intent.

**For Example:**
- **A Faction the crew have targeted previously come for revenge.**<br/>- The level of response probably depends on how badly they've been fucked with, from threats to murderous intent.
- **A PCs Rival makes moves to complicate their lives.**<br/>- They might damage their status with a contact, making them unavailable until they make amends.
- **A group of corrupt, Cerberus enforcers begin harassing the Crew.**<br/>- What do they want? Bribes? Dirty Work? Maybe nothing right now, but they want to make sure the Crew knows who's boss.
- **A Faction takes sudden interest in the crew.**<br/>- Everywhere they go, they can't help but feel watched..
- **Someone takes advantage of a lack of security to steal something from the Crew.**<br/>- A vehicle, or it's wheels/engine/stereo.
- **The location of the Crew's safehouse is revealed.**<br/>- Maybe someone is starting to sniff around. Or worse, it's being raided *right now*.

<br/>
- **GM Advice:** Don't feel like you *need* to do this every downtime. 
- Introduce these scenes when it is most dramatically appropriate, and/or when it serves to pressure the Crew into action.

## Crew Advancement
Much like individual Characters, the Crew as a whole improve over time. <br/>As the Crew become better known, more opportunities will open up to them.

### Status & Rank
**Status** indicates how well known, respected, and feared the Crew are among their clients, allies, and enemies. **As it increases, so does your Rank.**

Increasing your Rank brings with it access to **Advantages** (Safehouse, Market Contacts, etc), which might add Advantage<AD/> or Threat<TD/> dice to relevant checks.

<p class="text-center">The Crew Sheet displays ten, 8-Segment [Clocks](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#clocks--extended-checks). <br/>Every point of Status adds one tick to a clock.</p>

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 8/8 8/8 8/8 8/8 3/8 0/8 0/8 0/8 0/8 0/8 </div>
<p class="text-center"> Example: The crew have 4 Full Clocks, one at 3/8, the rest empty.<br/>The Crew are Rank 4 ("Connected") </p>
<br/>

**The number of fully filled clocks represents your Rank. Compare with the table below:**
| Status    | Rank                 | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

<p>
- **GM Advice:** For shorter, faster campaigns, half the number of clocks required for each Rank.
</p>

#### Gaining Status
**Status is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:**
<div class="sonohead">
|                |                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Success:** | Gain **+1** Status if the job was a success.<br/> Meaning, the primary objective was achieved (even if it came at a cost).                                       |
| **Archetype:** | Gain **+1** Status if the group played to the Strengths of your Crew Archetype.                                                                                  |
|     **Noise:** | Gain **+1** Status if you gained 2 or more Hostility during the job.                                                                                             |
|   **Profile:** | Gain **+1** to **+3** Status, depending on the Rank of the target.<br/> **0-1: +1**<br/> **2-3: +2**<br/> **4+: +3.**                                            |
|     **Bonus:** | At the GMs discretion, the Crew may gain an additional **+1-2** Status for longer jobs, or for especially successful jobs (Quiet, clean, bonus objectives, etc.) |


</div>

#### Losing Status
**1 tick of Status could be lost as part of a Bane or Major Consequence**
- This could represent a public embarrassment or betrayal that damages your reputation.
- You cannot take ticks from filled clocks. Once a clock is full, it is locked in. 

---

## Upgrades
In addition to the benefits of Rank, you can commit time, money, and skill toward Upgrades; Features and Benefits that help the entire Crew.

**As a note:** The Upgrades you choose should make logical sense within the fiction. *For example: Regular Clientele requires you to be running some sort of side business.*

### The Safehouse
Unlocked at Rank 2, the Crew have access to a shared Safehouse. This can be upgraded to expand its use.

Prior to this, the Crew can still have a place to meet and plan; a public place, an abandoned building, or a backroom in a building owned by a trusted contact.
The only implication is that they don't yet have the means or permission to start making improvements.

<p class="text-center">**When picking a Safehouse, pick a District to operate out of.**<br/>Work with the GM to pick an interesting location.</p>

- If for any reason you lose access to these Improvements (Moving Property, Destruction, Acts of God), you also lose the benefit you gained from it.

**When moving to a new Property, at the GM's discretion, carry over purchased improvements up to the Max of the new property.**
- This should always make sense within the fiction and typically doesn't include features the original property inherently had, such as the Tenement's "Gang Territory", or the Dojo's "Training Room"
