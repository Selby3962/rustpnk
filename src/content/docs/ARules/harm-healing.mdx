## Getting Hurt
Instead of a pool of Hit Points, Player Characters (PCs) suffer **Conditions, Wounds, and Traumas**.

### Conditions
<p class="text-center">**Conditions are temporary afflictions.**<br/> Physical, Situational, or Psychological problems that cause trouble in the short-term.
<br/>When a Condition is relevant to a check being made, it adds +1 Threat Dice <TD/> to the pool.
<br/>There is no limit to the number of Conditions you can have a time.</p>
<br/>

- Conditions typically go away on their own after some time, or can be treated with simple actions.<br/> - **For Example:** Moving away from the source of the problem, applying pressure to a wound, etc.
- If not dealt with, a Condition could be compounded upon to become a Level 1 Wound.<br/> - **For Example:** Bleeding -> Minor Bloodloss, or Drained -> Tired.
- In the right context, a condition could also be a positive, adding Advantage Dice <AD/> to checks.<br/> - **For Example:** Drunk/High and resisting pain.

<br/>
**Example Conditions:**
| Condition   | Example Effect                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bleeding    | You're visibly bloodied, <TD/> to Influence.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with.                     |
| Burning     | Doing most things while ignited is going to be difficult, <TD/>.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with. |
| Drugged     | Whatever you took, it's kicking in. <TD/> if the effect of the drug would hinder your action.                             |
| Drunk       | You're stumbling around, <TD/> to Mobility, Dodging.<br/> Your nerves are numbed, <AD/> to Resisting Pain                 |
| Panicking   | You can't even think straight, let alone shoot. <TD/> to Shooting, Thinking.                                              |
| Pinned Down | Under suppressive fire. <TD/> when trying to move or aim from your current location.<br/>                                 |
| Stunned     | Reeling from a strong blow. <TD/> to Awareness, Shooting, Dodge.                                                          |

<p class="text-center">The Conditions and Effects in the table above are purely examples. <br/>Follow the fiction and only apply <AD/>/<TD/> when it makes sense.</p>

### Wounds
<p class="text-center">**Wounds are specific, longer-lasting Injuries**
<br/>Wounds can be Minor (Level One), or Severe (Level Two).
<br/>Once per Scene, per Wound, the GM can invoke the Wound to add +1 <TD/> per level of the Wound.<br/>The Wound must be relevant/hindering to the Check being made.</p>


#### Minor Wounds (Level One)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Minor Wounds are the logical step up from Conditions.**</p><br/>

- Minor Wounds are removed when Recovering during Downtime.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Minor Wounds can be treat with First-Aid and/or the right gear.
- There are no hard-limits to Minor Wounds. However, if you ever take the same, or similar one twice, it becomes a Severe (Level Two) Wound.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Minor Wounds:**
| Wound                    |                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Black Eye                | Dislocated [Finger/Shoulder] |
| Bullet Graze             | Sprained [Joint]             |
| Concussion               | Fractured [Bone]             |
| Minor [Burns/Poisoning]  | Torn Muscle                  |
| Shallow [Cut/Stab Wound] | Cracked [Bone]               |
</div>

<br/>
#### Major Wounds (Level Two)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Severe Wounds are serious injuries, on track to becoming life-threatening.**</p><br/>

- Severe Wounds require medical attention during Downtime. Recovery in this way turns them into Minor Wounds.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Severe Wounds might be treatable with First-Aid and the right gear, either reducing or removing them.
- **Unlike Conditions and Minor Wounds, you can only have at most 3 different Level Two Wounds.**<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation. <br/> - If ever you need to write a Severe Wound, but all your boxes are full, immediately write a Trauma instead.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Severe Wounds:**
| Wound                        |                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Broken [Limb]                | Shattered [Joint/Bone] |
| Bullet Wound                 | Internal Bleeding      |
| Fractured Skull              | Organ Damage           |
| Severe [Bloodloss/Poisoning] | Deep [Cut/Stab Wound]  |
</div>

### Trauma
<p class="text-center">**Traumas are desperate, life-threatening injuries.**<br/> Traumas **always** add +2 <TD/> to checks.</p>

<br/>
- Traumas require serious medical attention during Downtime. Recovery this way turns them into Severe Wounds.
- During a job, Traumas can only be temporarily mitigated at best, enabled by specialist medical gear and augmentations.
- **You can have at most 2 different Traumas at a time.**<br/> - Upon filling your last Trauma box, you are **Lost**.<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation.

<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Trauma:**
| Wound              |                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Severed [Limb]     | Punctured [Vital Organ] |
| Massive Blood Loss | Organ Failure           |
| Brain Haemorrhage  | Paralysis               |
| 4th Degree Burns   | Crushed Chest           |
</div>

<br/>
#### Incapacitation
<p class="text-center">**When writing a new Trauma, you must immediately make the following Check to avoid being incapacitated.**</p>

- Add <AD/> for Toughness, or any other skill with expertise that provides resistance to pain and trauma.
- Add 1 <TD/> as a base.
- Add 1 <TD/> for each current Trauma and Condition.
- Add 1 <TD/> if you are currently within a dangerous environment that is actively harming you (toxins, fire, etc.)

<p/>
- **On a Major or Minor Success:** You persist and stay standing.
- **On a Hollow Success or Bane:** You succumb and fall to the floor, incapacitated.

While incapacitated, you require assistance from an ally soon, or else you will become **Lost**.<br/>
Use common sense to judge how long "soon" is. At most its the end of the scene, or a little longer than that.
<br/>

### Becoming Lost
<p class="text-center">**Signal Terminated**<br/>This dangerous life finally caught up to you.</p>



**Becoming "Lost" could mean a number of things:**
- **If it makes sense, and the player and GM agree, you die.** <br/> - Either immediately, or very soon. <br/> - You might get a check to do something heroic, and a last breath to say something dramatic.
- **You fall into a Coma.** <br/> - You aren't *dead*, but you ain't coming back any time soon, and not without life-changing issues.
- **Physically/Mentally Devastated** <br/> - By some cruel twist of fate, you're alive, but is that truly the better outcome?
- **M.I.A.** <br/> - Your crew lost sight of you in the chaos. You might not be dead, but you never made it back.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**At an appropriate moment, either immediately, or at the end of the session, the Player or the GM narrate a brief vignette, depicting (or alluding to..) the fate of the character.**</p>
<br/>

### And yet you persist..
<p class="text-center">**A character who is lost doesn't have to be gone for good.** <br/>The GM and the Player discuss options and come to a satisfactory compromise.</p>

**If it makes sense, the character may be able to return in some form:**
- **As an NPC, likely much later on, potentially as a shell of their former selves.**<br/> - The GM takes control of your character, but you might be allowed to speak for them in specific scenarios.
- **As a PC, but only after significant time and recovery, and with a permanent debuff.** <br/> - You won't be able to play as them while they recover. You might be able to do brief vignettes involving them during Downtime, if their whereabouts are known, but they're fully out of action otherwise.
<br/> **When they return, you have a new, and highly intrusive Flaw:** <br/> - Phantom Pains from a missing limb, visible and obvious burns/scarring, a personality disorder, panic attacks, etc. 
<br/> **You have one fewer Trauma boxes.**
<br/> - No amount of recovery will get you back to your former strength.
<br/> **Your luck is used up.**
<br/> - The next time you become lost, it's **[Game Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_j8W-SDefU)**.
