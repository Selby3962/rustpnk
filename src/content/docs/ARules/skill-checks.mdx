## What are Checks?

When a Character's course of action is uncertain, dangerous, or puts the character at risk, the GM will call for a **Check**. <br/>

<p class="text-center">**To start, explain what your character is attempting to do.**<br/>
**Describe what you want to achieve, and what approach your character is taking.**</p>

---

## Is a Check Required?
<p class="text-center">**Only call for checks if the outcome has the potential to create interesting consequences.**
<br/><br/>If a character has all the skill required, ample time to work without pressure, or there's nothing to be lost through failure, then there's no need to call for a check.</p>

## Gather your Dice Pool

Create a pool of **Advantage** (**AD**, or <AD/>) **dice** and **Threat** (**TD**, or <TD/>) **dice**; 6-sided dice in two different colours.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">You start with 0 <AD/> or <TD/></p>
<br/>

|       **Drive:** | Add 1 <AD/> if you are attempting something related to your **Drive**.                                                                                   |

|   **Toughness:** | Add <TD/> equal to the current Toughness of the threat.<br/>*Also the Health of the threat. Reduced as the threat takes damage.* <br/>*Note that Toughness does not need to be unique to living threats. A secure databank might also have a Toughness rating.* |
|   **Situation:** | Add 1 <TD/> for **each** relevant **Situational Disadvantage**: <br/>*Being rushed, poor positioning, poor lifestyle quality, etc.*                                                                                                                             |

</div>
<br/>
<p class="text-center">If for any reason you have 0 <AD/>. Roll 1 <AD/> but add an additional 1 <TD/></p>
<br/>

- **GM Advice: Don't feel you need to run this like a checklist each time.**
- For a basic check, start with Skill + Expertise VS Threat Rating. Add the top 2 or 3 most obvious or impactful Advantages and Threats and make the check.
- Any player can suggest factors that might add <AD/> or <TD/>, work together to build the pool. The GM has final say.
- The exception to this is Trauma, which should always be factored in.

### Assisting Allies
- If one or more allies are assisting you in some simple and straight-forward way, add +1<AD/>. <br/> *Multiple people providing simple assistance does not add more than +1 <AD/>.*
- For more complicated assistance, the people helping may need to make their own checks first. <br/>*E.g. Hacking security, causing a distraction etc.*<br/>*In these cases, each Major or Minor Success adds +1 <AD/>.*

### Using Expertise
You can use multiple Expertise in a single Check, as long as they're attached to the same Skill being used.<br/>
- *If you have a relevant Expertise attached to a different Skill, you can make a case for how you apply it in a different context.<br/>The GM has final say about whether or not it is appropriate.*
- The tables above include examples where an Expertise might be relevant to multiple skills, such as Intimidate (Fighting, Influence), or Sneak (Mobility, Subterfuge). Judge appropriateness based on the context in which the Expertise is being used.

## Roll the Dice
1. Discard any <AD/> and <TD/> showing <span class="AD">1</span><span class="TD">1</span>,<span class="AD">2</span><span class="TD">2</span>, or <span class="AD">3</span><span class="TD">3</span>
2. Pair each remaining <AD/> with one of the remaining <TD/>, and discard them.<br/>*The faces don't need to match. Any* <AD/> *cancels out any* <TD/>*.*
<p class="text-center"> **The Remaining unpaired Dice are your Result** </p>

---

## The Result 

### Outcomes

- **Major Success:** 1 or More <AD/> Remaining.
- **Minor Success:** A single <TD/>, or no <AD/>/<TD/> Remaining.
- **Hollow Success:** 2 or More <TD/> Remaining.

<p class="text-center"> Any remaining <Boon/> or <Bane/> (dice showing 6's), become **Boons** and **Banes**, granting additional **Advantages**, or causing additional **Consequences**.</p>

### Interpreting the Outcome
Depending on the Outcome, the Player Character (PC) rolling the check may Succeed flawlessly, gain an **Advantage**, or, more often, suffer some kind of **Consequence**.

- **Major Success could mean:**
    - You do it, with no Consequences
    - You do it, and there's an additional Advantage

- **Minor Success could mean:**
    - You do it, but it might be less effective
    - You do it, but with a Minor Consequence 
    - You don’t do it, but avoid any Consequences

- **Hollow Success could mean:**
    - You do it, but it might be drastically less effective
    - You do it, but with a Major Consequence
    - You do it, but with a couple of Minor Consequences.
    - You don’t do it, but suffer a Minor Consequence

- **Boons:** Add additional Advantages
- **Banes:** Add additional Consequences

<br/>
<p class="text-center"> **Whatever happens, use the result to describe the outcome and progress the story.** </p>
<br/>

- **GM Advice:** "Fails" are called "Hollow" Success, to emphasise that they don't *have* to result in saying "No" to what a player attempts to do.
- A Hollow outcome may still result in progress, but come at a major cost. When it makes sense in the fiction, ask the Player if they want to push ahead and suffer the consequences, or back down (play it safe), to reduce them.
- Ideally, even "Failure" should present a new challenge to overcome, and/or push players toward an alternative solution.
- Crucially, remember that you only need to call for a Check when the result has the potential to create interesting consequences.

## Clocks & Extended Checks
Sometimes one roll isn't enough to overcome particularly complex problems, and multiple players may need to work together to solve them.

In these instances the GM might call for an "Extended Check". These typically take the form of a "Clock".

Clocks are an easy visual way to display progress toward an objective. 

<p class="text-center">Draw a circle, and split it up into segments. <br/>
Each time a player makes a check, fill in segments based on the result. <br/>
The more segments a clock has, the more successes players will need to overcome it.</p>

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 1/3 . 2/4 . 3/6 . 4/8 . 03/6 </div>

### Positive Clock
If the Clock fills entirely, the player's goal is a achieved.

**For example:**
- **Major Success:** mark two segments. 
- **Minor Success:** mark one segment. 
- **Hollow Success:** mark zero segments.
- **Boons:** mark additional segments.
- **Banes:** remove segments.

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 5/6 </div>
<p class="text-center p-0 m-0"> **Crack the Vault** </p>

### Negative Clock
Likewise, you can reverse the Consequences to represent a negative outcome:

**For example:**
- **Major Success:** mark zero segments. 
- **Minor Success:** mark one segment. 
- **Hollow Success:** mark two segments.
- **Boons:** remove segments.
- **Banes:** mark additional segments.

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 1/6 </div>
<p class="text-center p-0 m-0"> **Security go on High Alert** </p>

### Opposed Clocks
Clocks are also handy for representing the push and pull of two opposing sides in a conflict. Useful for abstracting and tracking the longer-term power dynamics of factions.

**For example:**
- Draw a clock with an even number of segments, and fill in half of them straight away.
- Fill in or erase segments as the two sides make moves against each other.
- One side wins if the clock fills, the other wins if the clock empties.

<div class="clock w-full text-center"> 3/6 </div>
<p class="text-center p-0 m-0"> **Turf War** </p>

---

## Action Points
Action Points are a limited currency that represent a pool of inner strength and resolve that a player's character can tap into to push themselves.

You begin play with a Maximum of 3AP, and start each job with a full pool. You can increase your AP limit with [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).

### Spending Action Points (AP)
Spending Action Points allows players to manipulate their odds, the scene, and the flow of combat.


**Action Points can be spent on the following:**
- **Improve Result:** Spend 1 AP to improve the result of a roll by one level.
<br/><p class="text-center">*Hollow -> Minor -> Major*<br/>*Any Banes still add additional Consequences.*</p>
- **Ignore Banes:** Spend 1 AP to ignore all remaining <Bane/>'s
<br/><p class="text-center">*This doesn't discard the* <TD/>. *Treat ignored* <Bane/> *as if they are showing a* <span class="TD">5</span></p>
- **Seize Momentum:** Steal or Maintain [Momentum](/rustpnk/docs/arules/combat-harm-healing#momentum) from the Enemy.
<br/><p class="text-center">*Describe what you do to create a momentary distraction or opportunity*<br/>*The Player who spent the point decides who Acts.*<br/>**Losing Momentum is unavailable as a Consequence for this first check.**</p>
- **Tough it Out:** Ignore the <TD/> penalty of a single Trauma until the adrenaline wears off.
<br/><p class="text-center">*Describe how you steel yourself and push past your wounds*<br/>*The Trauma is still there, you're just ignoring it. It will return once the adrenaline wears off. Typically, the first relatively calm moment to catch your breath.*</p>
- **Make a Declaration:** Change a detail about the scene, or purchase and use equipment you didn’t previously have. 
<br/><p class="text-center">*The guard's comms light up and they hurriedly leave their post.*<br/>*The camera at the end of the hall is malfunctioning.*<br/>*You pull a grenade (pay the ₩) and jam it into the maw of the Cyberhound.*</p>

<p class="text-center"> **The GM has final say on what uses are/aren't appropriate. Work together to reach a satisfying compromise.** </p>

### Recovering Action Points
**Action Points can be refreshed by:**
- You can spend a **Boon** <Boon/> to gain 1 AP.
- If you or the GM invoke **Flaw** to hinder a check and gain 1 AP.<br/>Each Flaw can only be invoked once per-job. It can still impact the fiction, but it won't apply <TD/> or restore Action Points.
- When a check results in any number of **Banes** <Bane/> gain 1 AP.
- Taking Harm that results in a **Trauma** grants 1 AP.
- At the **end of a Job**, restore AP back to its maximum.

<p class="text-center"> **You cannot recover AP above your Maximum AP.** </p>
